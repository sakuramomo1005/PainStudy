### Estimands in a Chronic Pain Trial: Challenges and Opportunities
Francesca Callegari et. all

primary estimand and estimation method 

Primary variable: defined as the weekly mean of 24-hr
average pain score change from baseline to the end of the
double-blind treatment period and assessed using the 11-
point numerical rating scale. The 24-hr average pain is
recorded daily by each patient on a scale from zero (“no
pain”) to 10 (“pain as bad as you can imagine”). The weekly
mean is obtained by averaging the seven daily measurements
of each week.

Summary measure: defined as treatment difference of
variable means of the study drug and placebo

The primary estimation method (related to the primary estimand)
will be based on an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA)
model including region, treatment, gender, use of concomitant
pain medication at baseline as factors and baseline age and baseline
mean pain intensity score as covariates

missing data will
be imputed via multiple imputation using the missing at
random (MAR) assumption.
